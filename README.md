Fenix A320 Efis Display for Mobiflight

This is a small project (still in development) to realize an A320 Efis Display for Fenix with Mobiflight. The thing is that the 0,96" Display is connected to a second Arduino (tested with Leonardo) 
which ist connected via i2c to an Arduino Mega with Mobiflight.

The Oled display (AZDelivery 1x 0,96 Zoll OLED Display - I2C SSD1306 Chip 128 x 64 Pixel I2C) is connected to the second Arduino SDA to pin 13 and SCL to pin 11


I will make a better description in the next couple of days.
